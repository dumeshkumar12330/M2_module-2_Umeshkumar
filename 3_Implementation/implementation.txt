1. In this chapter, the design and implementation of human following robot is discussed.

This project's main goal is to create a robot which can follow humans. There are two aspects to the project: hardware and software. It is made up of three primary components: inputs, main controller, and output, as indicated.

2. Software implementation

In this chapter, the design and development of algorithm of program logic is discussed. The flowchart to develop the program logic with the program implementation is also being discussed. 

when anything comes near to the left sensor Arduino got the information that there is something is near to the left sensors and according to the code, the robot will turn to the left. and the same process for the right sensor. so this is how the human following robot works.

There are four motors. to run front and back 
It uses reversing technology in the front two motors to turn right and left

The pseudo code is explained below

tep 1:Start
Step 2:Initialize motor 1,2,3,4
Step 3:Checks the Value Difference of ultrasoni sensor and IR sensor 
Step 4:Check the condition
         if((Right_Value==1) && (distance>=10 && distance<=30)&&(Left_Value==1)) (ultrasonic sensor)
         # all motors run in forward direction
Step 5:Checks the condition  
         if((Right_Value==0) && (Left_Value==1)) IR sensor both the sides 
          # front 2 motors run forward and back 2 motors runs backwords 

Step 6:Checks the condition
         if((Right_Value==1)&&(Left_Value==1)) IR sensor 
         #  all motors RELEASE 

Step 7:Checks the condition
        if(distance > 1 && distance < 10)
        # all motors release 
Step 8:if It is to close to the object it will stop 
            then go back to step 6
Step 9:END.
