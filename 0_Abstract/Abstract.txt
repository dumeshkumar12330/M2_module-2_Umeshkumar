I have done a human following robot, working model and simulation using simulIDE

Human following robot is very common in this technology era. Human following is a technique used by robot and autonomous vehicles to follow a human within a specific range. In this case, communication between the human and the robot is the most significant factor where sensor is needed to ensure its successfulness.
It can be used in carry cases so they would follow the human being.

Due to requirement of Ir sensor in project, simulide is dosent have it so i have exculed the part of IR sensor in simulation.

What are the advantages of human following robot?
1) They can be used in industries as automated equipment carriers
2) It can be used for home for floor cleaning etc. 
3) In hotels they are being used for the transfer of things from one place to another following a straight path
